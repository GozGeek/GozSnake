## GozSnake

The source code is in the src/ directory, while a disk image with the files is in the root.

## Playing

The disk image, `GozSnake.atr` is a bootable image which will automatically start up the game.

The controls to move up and down are the A and Z key, while left and right is , and . keys.

## What is this about?

I've been live coding this game over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/gozgeek), and to help share the game, I automatically keep the source code in sync as I code. Directions on doing this [over at my blog](https://www.gozgeek.com/posts/2022/syncing-live-coding-from-my-atari-1200xl-to-github/).
